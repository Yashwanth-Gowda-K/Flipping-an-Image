# Flipping-an-Image

Problem: Flipping an Image
Given an n x n binary matrix, perform two operations:

Flip: Reverse each row horizontally
Invert: Replace all 0s with 1s and vice versa

Solution Approach:
Achieves O(nÂ²) time complexity by processing each element once
Uses efficient in-place operations for minimal memory usage
Handles edge cases like symmetric rows gracefully

Key Insight:
The transformation combines a simple reversal with binary negation, demonstrating how basic operations can solve matrix problems elegantly.
